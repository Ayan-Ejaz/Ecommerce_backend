## E-Commerce Backend System
This is a scalable and modular e-commerce backend system built using Node.js, Express, and Sequelize ORM. It follows a layered architecture and integrates modern backend practices including Redis caching, Stripe payment gateway, and Twilio SMS notifications.

**Features**
Layered Architecture: Clean separation between controllers, services, and data layers for maintainability and scalability.

Role-Based Authorization: Admin and user roles with restricted access controls.

API Gateway: Centralized routing of requests to services like /product, /order, and /payment.

**Redis Integration:**
Cart Management: User cart state is maintained in Redis for quick access.

Caching: Frequently added-to-cart products are cached to reduce database lookups.

Stripe Payment Gateway: Secure and real-world payment handling using Stripeâ€™s paymentIntent API.

Twilio SMS Notifications: Real-time SMS notifications on delivery

MySQL with Sequelize: SQL database support with Sequelize models and migrations.

Error Handling & Validations: Centralized error handlers and input validation to ensure robust API behavior.
